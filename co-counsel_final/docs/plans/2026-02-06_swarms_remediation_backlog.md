# Swarms Remediation Backlog (2026-02-06)

## Critical
- Timeline builder exports (MD/PDF/XLSX/HTML) + storyboard mode.
- Forensics hardening (ELA/clone/font/object analysis) + crypto tracing depth (wallet clustering, transaction enrichment).
- War room orchestration UI with phase control + audit trail.
- Court integrations (LACS, PACER, UniCourt) with compliance and payment flows.

## High
- 3D graph explorer data wiring + live graph updates.
- Exhibit binder builder + presentation assistant backend.
- Voice assistant production wiring (STT/TTS pipeline + orchestration).
- QA Swarm scoring across all phases with citation coverage gates.

## Medium
- Mock trial arena integration with scenario engine and interactive playback.
- Trial University content service + progress tracking.
- Dev Swarm workflow for proposals and approvals.

## Dependencies
- Court integrations require provider agreements and credential management.
- Forensics hardening may require GPU availability and additional libraries.
- Timeline exports require document rendering services (PDF/XLSX).

## Next Phase Proposal (Pick 2–3)
1. Timeline export + storyboard (critical)
2. Forensics + crypto hardening (critical)
3. War room orchestration UI (critical)
