# Swarms Roadmap and Milestones

## Milestone 0: Platform Baseline
- Swarms orchestration for all core phases.
- LlamaIndex ingestion and indexing.
- Graph upserts and refinement loop.
- Workflow persistence and artifact storage.

## Milestone 1: Critical Litigation Outputs
- Autonomous, interactive timeline builder with citations, filters, and exports (Markdown, PDF, XLSX, HTML).
- Timeline storyboard mode with optional image and video aids.
- Evidence binder builder and presentation assistant Swarm.
- Drafting outputs for motions, briefs, and hearing prep.

## Milestone 2: Forensics and Financial Intelligence
- Forensic media analysis (ELA, clone/splicing, font and object analysis).
- Crypto tracing and asset tracking with hardened APIs, ETH token clustering, and cross-chain bridge matching.
- Financial forensics workflows and reporting.

## Milestone 3: Interactive Experience and Visualization
- 3D graph explorer with entity clustering and relationship filters.
- “CENTCOM War Room” Swarm orchestration view with run control and audit trails.
- Retro mock-trial arena experience (interactive training and simulation).
- UI and controls redesign.

## Milestone 4: Court Integrations and External Data
- LACS.org integration for e-filing, calendars, local rules, and docket status.
- PACER and UniCourt integrations for state/federal document access.
- Case law integrations (CourtListener, Case.law) with automated sync.
- Secure payment processing for paid document retrieval.

## Milestone 5: Training and Education
- Trial University module with boot-camp style training paths.
- Motion practice guides, courtroom tactics, and procedural checklists.

## Milestone 6: Autonomy and Quality Systems
- QA Swarm layer across all phases with citation and artifact checks.
- Dev team Swarm for incremental maintenance and upgrades.
- Clear separation between automated pipeline and user-driven workflows.

## Epics and Feature Set
- Autonomous pipeline from ingestion through drafted documents.
- Manual re-trigger for any Swarm, phase, or tool subset.
- Forensics suite and crypto tracing.
- Timeline engine with citations and exports.
- Exhibit binder and presentation builder.
- 3D graph explorer and refinement.
- Swarm orchestration control center.
- Voice-activated Co-Counsel assistant.
- Interactive mock trial arena.
- Training and curriculum module.
- Court integrations with secure document retrieval.

## Dependencies and Risks
- Third-party API access (LACS, PACER, UniCourt) and compliance.
- Payment processing and document fee handling.
- GPU capacity for vision and speech models.

## Status Tracking
- Track each milestone in docs/logs/reproducibility.md with dated progress entries.
