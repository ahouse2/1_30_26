# Task Plan: Gap Closure + Ship-Readiness Workstream

## Goal
Close every remaining gap in the master task list with vertical-slice completion, then harden for ship-readiness.

## Phases
- [x] Phase 1: Plan and setup
- [x] Phase 2: Timeline builder + storyboard + exports
- [x] Phase 3: UI redesign + orchestration polish
- [ ] Phase 4: Live checklist + gap triage (authoritative)
- [ ] Phase 5: Vertical-slice completion (per epic)
- [ ] Phase 6: QA + E2E validation + logs

## Key Questions
1. Are all remaining gaps explicitly listed and tracked in the live checklist?
2. Is each epic complete end-to-end before moving to the next?
3. Are logs and reproducibility steps captured for every major change?

## Decisions Made
- Use vertical-slice completion: finish one full feature set before moving to the next.
- Maintain a live checklist view synced with master task list.
- Proceed under presumed assent unless blocked by missing APIs.

## Errors Encountered
- None yet.

## Status
**Currently in Phase 4** - building live checklist and finalizing gap triage.
